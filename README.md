# JS Experimental Repo

## About
In this repo, I will be posting some experimental code that I learn or come
up with.

The motivation, is to have some sort of reference to code that I've written,
or patterns to reference or improve in the future.

If you are interested, please feel free to have a look in the code and suggest
improving it or making it more robust. Remember the whole idea is to learn JS
better and improve my skills with it.
